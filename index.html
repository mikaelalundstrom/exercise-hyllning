            <h1>A Celebration of Kermit the Frog</h1>
            <h2>Who is Kermit the Frog?</h2>
            <p>Kermit the Frog is a Muppet character created and originally performed by Jim Henson in 1955. Kermit is
                the pragmatic everyman protagonist of numerous Muppet productions, most notably as the showrunner and
                host of the sketch comedy television series The Muppet Show and a featured role on Sesame Street. He has
                appeared in other television series, feature films, specials, and public service announcements through
                the years</p>
            <h2>Accolades and commemorations</h2>
            <p>Kermit was awarded an honorary doctorate of Amphibious Letters (a pun on the more common honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters) on May 19, 1996, at Southampton College, New York, where he also gave a commencement speech. He is also the only "amphibian" to have had the honor of addressing the Oxford Union.A statue of Henson and Kermit was erected on the campus of Henson's alma mater, the University of Maryland, College Park in 2003. </p>
            <p>On November 14, 2002, Kermit the Frog received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the category of Television. The star is located at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. Kermit has two stars on the Walk of Fame, the other as a member of the collective The Muppets, which they received on March 20, 2012 in the category of Motion Pictures.</p>
            <h2>So, why is Kermit so cool?</h2>
            <p>First, he has an uncanny way of turning ordinary things into wonderful things. In his wise words, Kermit
                once said, “It’s not that easy being green.” While this sentiment may sound discouraging, in his usual
                optimistic way, he turns it around and makes it about how there is beauty in being plain.</p>
            <ul>

                <li>...he is very relatable</li>
                <li>...but most importantly, he's a frog!</li>
            </ul>
