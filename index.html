            <h1>A Celebration of Kermit the Frog</h1>
            <h2>Who is Kermit the Frog?</h2>
            <p>Kermit the Frog is a Muppet character created and originally performed by Jim Henson in 1955. Kermit is
                the pragmatic everyman protagonist of numerous Muppet productions, most notably as the showrunner and
                host of the sketch comedy television series The Muppet Show and a featured role on Sesame Street. He has
                appeared in other television series, feature films, specials, and public service announcements through
                the years</p>
            <h2>So, why is Kermit so cool?</h2>
            <p>First, he has an uncanny way of turning ordinary things into wonderful things. In his wise words, Kermit
                once said, “It’s not that easy being green.” While this sentiment may sound discouraging, in his usual
                optimistic way, he turns it around and makes it about how there is beauty in being plain.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>...he is very fashionable</li>
                <li>...he is very relatable</li>
                <li>...but most importantly, he's a frog!</li>
            </ul>
